This vscode extension highlights the world types of the wonderful [Roguetype](https://github.com/Octachron/roguetype) typing adventure.

After installing, just open the file `game.ml` of the game's code in a new editor and you should see the rows of the world types decorated as follows:

- free cells dimmed out
- obstacles, gates, doors and altar over colorful backgrounds 
- monsters in various shades of red
- glowy pickable items

Happy typing
